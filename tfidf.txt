TF-IDF is an NLP technique that assesses the importance of a word in its document in relation to its entire corpus. It requires a lot of preprocessing of the data with text lemmatization and stop word/special character removal. The ‘TF score’ or term frequency of a word or term counts the number of times the word occurs in a single document across all documents and the ‘IDF score’ or inverse document frequency of  a word keeps track how frequently a word occurs in the entirety of a text corpus and weighs more significance to words that have low frequencies. This helps to sort out words like ‘film’ that might occur in multiple reviews but don’t have much meaning to them. After performing TF-IDF, we were able to use the most significant words and create individual summaries consisting of the most important words in reviews for each movie in the dataset. These summaries were utilized in the rest of our analysis including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and even creating word clouds categorizing different genres.
