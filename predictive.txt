We decided to determine how well our sentiment analysis scores could predict the overall audience score associated with a movie on rotten tomatoes. To do this, we create a Random Forest Model that takes as input a movie. It then scrapes both critics and audience reviews from that movie and performs the sentiment analysis described above. The model then uses the average sentiment scores of the reviews to make a prediction of the audience score. We were able to achieve an accuracy of around 87%.
