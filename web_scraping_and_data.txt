For our project, the first step was determining which movies we wanted to focus on and scrape the reviews associated with those movies. We chose to pick the top 100 movies for each year from 2000 to 2020, as these popular movies would have sufficient number of reviews to generate our corpus and find any interesting temporal trends if they exist. In order to perform the web scraping, we used pythonâ€™s requests and BeautifulSoup packages. We decided to scrape one page worth of reviews for each movie. For each review, we also scraped the attributes associated with the review such as the score of the review and the rotten tomatoes decision for the review (fresh or rotten). We were able to use this data for our sentiment analysis model.

In addition to the reviews, to carry out alternate lines of analysis we also scraped some data associated with each of our chosen movies. This included the release date, genre, rating, language, Audience Score and Rotten Tomatoes score for each movie.

Finally, web scraping is also used in our audience score prediction model as the model scrapes all the reviews for an input movie in real time and then runs a sentiment analysis on the scraped reviews to generate features.
