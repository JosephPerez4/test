0,"['I used to watch it when I was a child. After 15 years, this movie is still fresh and enjoyable. The stop motion is amazing. Moreover, i found out this is an ecological and environmental reinterpretation of the Holocaust and it made me appreciate the movie even more', 'Clever story and funny to watch', 'While Chicken Run has a great animation style and compelling characters, the plot of the film was too generic and cliche for me.', ""I guess I'm part of the minority who isn't that impressed with the animation. The story is interesting and I get the holocaust parallels. But it just didn't keep my interest, even with the short run-time."", 'On one side we have chickens as symbols for humanity.\nOn the other side we have fried chicken, baked chicken, pineapple chicken, lemon chicken, coconut chicken, pepper chicken, chicken soup, chicken stew, chicken salad, chicken and potatoes, chicken burgers, chicken sandwich and chicken parmesan.\nYou get the idea.', 'This movie was already way ahead of it\'s time back when it was released. It\'s not the story of ""an america  rooster who falls in love with a British chicken"", it is literally the story of a group of women enslaved workers joining forces to escape a Nazi working camp\nSpoilers:\nThis movie has simply amazing dynamics between women, be it friendship, disagreement, protection, union, hopelessness... and the story of their visionary leader, willing to sacrifice herself so that those she lead could experience freedom. Her friendship with Mac, a woman engineer, is heartwarming especially when they see the fruit of all their hard work: their plane is ready.\nRocky is your regular selfish overconfident man, that is, until his character development brings him to be honest, to not turn a blind eye to those suffering around him, to care, and ultimately to find the courage and dignity to join the chickens\' cause. Over his character development, he also finally becomes worthy of the amazing woman (or hen) Ginger is.', 'found very entertaining', 'my sister loves this movie. that probably says it all. 10/10.', ""This is such a good slapstick movie. It's not really cringe to look at. The performance is great, the story is well done and the action scenes are exciting. One of dreamworks best film ever made!"", ""I grew up watching this film and its very unique and tells a basic story about Chickens trying to escape from a cruel farm. I'm not a massive fan of this style of animation though.""]"
