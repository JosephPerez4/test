Rotten Tomatoes is a platform that aggregates movie reviews from movie critics and audiences. It contains a plethora
of text data as well as metadata about a vast amount of different movies. Rotten Tomatoes' Tomatometer, based on the
scores given by its registered movie critics, is also one of the most widely utilized tools for summarizing a movie's
critical reception. Unlike websites such as imdb, which use data from a large database of users, Rotten Tomatoes only
accepts critic reviews from verified critics.

The nature of reviews on Rotten Tomatoes allows us to perform various different forms of natural language processing
and text analysis techniques that tell us a great deal about the movies. The audience reception of movies is a key
factor in the movie creation process. There are movies that may have positive critical reception, but still be seen
in a poor light by audiences. In our project, we analyzed the text of the audience and critic reviews, performed
predictive analysis on the audience's receptions of the movies, and also created a text generation model that mimics
a critic that would write movie reviews for Rotten Tomatoes.
