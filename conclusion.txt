Through our early analysis we found that critics on average gave higher ratings than audiences. We conducted sentiment analysis in order to compare the critics vs. audience sentiment on movies and found that they both had similar numbers of positive and negative reviews with the majority of  both of their reviews typically containing more neutral language. Upon building a predictive model, we found that the sentiment scores of critic reviews and audience reviews were good predictors of audience ratings/scores of a movie. After collecting this data, we sought to build a text generator and we found that by grouping the movie reviews by their movie genre we were able to improve our model results.
