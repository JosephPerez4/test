Our research and analysis provided us with a thorough and complete picture of the nature of the movies through the data that we scraped. Using sentiment analysis we were able to quantify the positive or negative feelings in the movie review data. We were then able to utilize these values in our predictive analysis model. By using TF-IDF and topic modeling, we were also able to represent our text data in a summarized format that still conveys a large amount of information. These are seen in the word clouds and summaries derived from Tf-IDF value, and in the topic modeling visualization. Finally, by tuning hyperparameters, we were able create a text generation model that successfully generates robust text outputs that simulate the given genres.
