Topic Modelling is an unsupervised machine learning technique which looks for certain structures within the text corpus and groups the text into certain ‘topics’ of similarity. In this case, we used a topic modelling technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA), which is less prone to overfitting with large datasets and uses generative probability to classify the texts. We preprocessed the text by getting rid of stop words and lamenting words to their root form and then used the LDA package in python to categorize all reviews of each movie into 15 different topics. While increasing the number of topics parses the data out a lot, we were working with over 2000 movies and their collective reviews. Our topics were well generated because according to the visualization, they are all spread out and don’t overlap, which similar to k-means clustering would result in similar topics and insignificant categorization. We also generated this model so it would be useful to take in new movies and their reviews and see what topic they fall under as well as what movies are similar to it (close to a movie recommendation model).
